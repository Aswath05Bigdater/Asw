FoundationDB is an open source transactional key value store which combines the felxibilty of flexibility and scalability of NoSQL architectures with the 
power of __ACID transactions__. It offers a minimal and carefully chosen feature set, which has enabled a range of disparate systems to be built as layers on top
FoundationDB adopts an unbundled architecture that decouples an
- _in-memory transaction management system_
-  _distributed storage system_
- _built-in distributed configuration system_ 

Each sub-system can be independently scaled. FoundationDB uniquely integrates a deterministic simulation framework, used to test every new feature of the system.
